I strongly believe that my personal qualities and interpersonal skills offers a great fit for this program, the program offers a great opportunity to experience new different set of environment and education experience than those I currently experience.</p>
		<p>I’m a very passionate, dynamic and energetic person who always seek new challenges to learn, improve further and build my character and future to deliver highest quality standards in each job and role I do, I’m very optimistic person despite the very unique challenging context I live in, but I’m empowered with the believe that a better future is possible, I demonstrate courage and self-assurance and self-awareness to excel in any assigned role I do and I’m always hungry to learn and develop more.</p>
		<p>My main goal and biggest dream is that one day I could start a career at <span>Google</span>. I'm very optimistic and passionate when it comes to achieving this goal, I was called so many things just for having such a dream, but by believing in my self and hard work that what so called an out of reach goal can be achieved. This course is such a huge step forward for myself that could provide me with enough knowledge to proceed by my self in favor of achieving my dreams.</p>
